# Agriculuture-Comsol-App
An app that helps people in hot developing countries understand how to properly store the potatoes they have grown. This application should be given to a local weather station so that they can provide advice on storage conditions based off of weather warnings.

In many developping countries cold storage is not possible. Instead, many people dig pits underneath the sand to store their produce. This is a very manually intensive task and can take a long time ot dig a deep enough pit to store all your harvested produce. If a heatwave is forecasted for the future. A local weatherstation can run this application and then suggest how deep people should bury their produce to protect their food from the heat.
